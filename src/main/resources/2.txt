in the constructor of TransactionalTopologyBuilder. 
In this example, MemoryTransactionalSpout is used which reads in data from an in-memory 
partitioned source of data (the DATA variable). The second argument defines the fields 
for the data, and the third argument specifies the maximum number of tuples to emit from each partition per batch of tuples. 
The interface for defining your own transactional spouts is discussed later on in this tutorial.
Now on to the bolts. This topology parallelizes the computation of the global count.
