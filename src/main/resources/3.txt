The first bolt, BatchCount, randomly partitions the input stream using a shuffle grouping 
and emits the count for each partition. The second bolt, UpdateGlobalCount, does a global grouping 
and sums together the partial counts to get the count for the batch. It then updates the global 
count in the database if necessary.
